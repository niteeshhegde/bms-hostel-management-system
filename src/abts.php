 <h1>About BMSET HOSTELS<h1><h3>
The BMS College of Engineering is a prestigious institution in our country, which provides accommodation to the students wishing to reside in the hostels. In a hostel like ours, one has the advantage of exposure to students from different regions, religions, languages and customs of our country. This composition of “MINI INDIA” will enable a hostelite to understand and appreciate another hostelite from other regions of our country. This is in addition to other aspects of living as one community in the hostel will lead to all-round development of personality of a hostelite and will definitely go a long way in fostering unity of our country.

Each hostel is an independent unit in respects to its internal administration under the overall supervision of council of wardens and the hostel management. The hostels are located in the southern side and adjacent to the college campus and have a separate hostel office and mess within the hostel premises. The mess has a centralized modern kitchen and a separate dining hall for boys and girls. Special menu will be introduced and served in the mess on all important religious festivals.

Hostel celebrates almost all festivals celebrated across the country such as Independence day, holi, diwali, lakshmi, saraswathi and ganesha festivals etc. The annual hostel magazine is being released on the occasion of the hostel day.
