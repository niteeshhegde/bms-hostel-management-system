  <h2>RULES AND REGULATIONS</h2><br />
  <h3>
Students must occupy rooms specifically allotted to them.
They are not allowed to change rooms except with the
written permission of the Warden/ Chief Warden.
However, students can pair up as per their choice within
first few days. They may contact their Hostel Warden for
this purpose.
Change of accommodation from one hostel to another
during a term is generally not permitted.
Allotment made to a student is subject to cancellation if
he/she fails to occupy the room in the prescribed time.
Students will also forfeit their rooms if they fail to clear all
their dues to the hostel by the appointed day. In such
cases they will be asked to vacate the hostel.
The Chief Warden reserves the right to break open rooms
in case of any violation of hostel rules, suspected unlawful
activities or on the basis of security risk perceived.
Once a student vacates the hostel, he/she will not be reallotted
hostel accommodation for a minimum period of 6
months. Every attempt will be made to provide hostel
accommodation to all students.</h3>
